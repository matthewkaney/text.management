## [0.6.0] - 2022-12-25

Initial release of Electron app with code editing and Tidal support.

## Early Versions

The first few versions existed to track changes in the NPM package version
of text.management. They were never tagged in the repository, and NPM updates
have been discontinued for the time being as I focus on an Electron/web app
distributed through GitHub releases.
